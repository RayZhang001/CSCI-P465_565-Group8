    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <!-- This section introduces the design approach to the software system.<br> -->
    <!-- <br> -->
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.1 System Description</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <!-- Provide a description of the system, and the problem that is being solved by developing the system (may be copied from the Project Plan or Software Specification if those documents are accurate) -->
        Our product, noQ., aims to reduce the strife seen at career fairs by implementing various pre-screening measures so that only the most qualified students can meet with companies on the day of the fair. In doing so, students will be able to skip the line
        at their preferred companies if they are qualified for positions they are applying to, companies can filter certain skills that will be needed for their positions, and will create a more pleasant career fair experience as a whole.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.2 Design Evolution</h3>
    <!-- <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        This section is intended to document the rationale behind the selected design solution.<br>
    </div>
    <br> -->
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.2.1 Design Issues</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <!-- Include in this section any issues/requirements/constraints that drive the design of the system.&nbsp; This may include desired operating environment, interface protocols, the need to be remotely accessible, etc.<br><br>  -->
        The system is intended to be used for both recruiters and applicants to undergo screening procedures that can be done before an on-campus career fair, thus applicants should be able to review available positions and send their profile along with their
        applications to recruiters before the career fair, and recruiters should have the ability to post available positions and access applicants' profiles remotely and inform applicants about the result and next steps. The system should give user ability
        to access corresponding data remotely and should not be operating environment dependent.

        <!-- applicants should apply for posted positions online first, and should have the ability to chat
        with recruiters over the internet once applicants' first stage applications are approved. Recruiters should also be able to access applicants' online profiles and make decisions according to position requirements. -->
        <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.2.2 Candidate Design Solutions</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <!-- Briefly (a paragraph or two) describe each of the possible design solutions that your team discussed/explored. -->
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <h5>Solution 1</h5>
            Applicants would be able to scan their resume with a mobile application and create their profile during the check-in process in a career fair and then apply for positions in the same application. Recruiters can review submitted profiles and give applicants
            permission of having an in-person interview.

            <h5>Solution 2</h5>
            Applicants would be able to log in to our website by creating their accounts or login their third party accounts such as LinkedIn, and then build their profile, apply to positions from a list of jobs that they are qualified for. Then they should have
            the ability to chat with recruiters over the internet once their first stage applications are approved. Recruiters should be able to access applicants' online profiles and give candidates permission of having an in-person interview during
            a career fair.
        </div>

    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.2.3 Design Solution Rationale</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <!-- Provide some reasoning for the design option that your development team selected.&nbsp; Tie in the selected approach's ability to meet the requirements, and most effectively address the design issues. -->
        Solution 2 was selected by the development team. Based on the consideration of timeline, budget and our objectives, solution 2 meets our requirements best. The system have to include an online service and be operating environment dependent, thus an web
        application would be more appropriate. Additionally, mobile applications for different operating system is way beyond our capability within the time frame of the project.

        <br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.3 Design Approach</h3>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.3.1 Methods</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">

        We used object-oriented design because we believe that will best allow us to build our project. Using UML diagrams, we can easily see the relationships between each class, which allows us to further understand and develop our product. We also used sequence
        diagrams in order to showcase how the whole process will start, end, and the steps in between. This allows us to capture every step in the process, which is highly important in developing a perfect product for our customers.
    </div>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.3.2 Standards</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        We did not necessarily adhere to any singular design standard. When designing a component, we holistically evaluated the pros and cons to each design we made, ensuring the highest possible product was produced. For naming conventions, we went with the
        industry standard for uppercase class names, and camel-case for functions.
    </div>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.3.3 Tools</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        We plan to use StarUML to help us design UML diagrams. In this program, we can build UML diagrams by dragging and dropping various connections/attributes, such as composition and inheritance. This is instrumental in designing UML diagrams, and the returned
        diagram will help us design the highest quality product.
    </div>
    <br>
    <h2>2. System Architecture</h2>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">2.1 System Design</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

        NoQ is based on the MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node technology stack. The figure below shows the system architecture at the higher level.

        <img src='noq-system-architecture.svg' style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" />

        <p>The client can access the web app through any internet based browser. The front-end technologies include <b>Vue.js</b>, which is the front-end framework, <b>Bootstrap</b>, which is a front-end styling framework, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. Vue.js
            can be used to make AJAX requests, make flexible and stable websites. Bootstrap is a styling library that has a plethora of classes to make a website look good. HTML and CSS are core web design languages.</p> Vue.js makes axios requests to
        the server that is built upon <b>Node.js</b>. <b>Express.js</b> is a library for node.js that includes a tonne of functions to handle requests and send reponses back to front-ends. The databse being used is <b>MongoDB</b>. <b>Mongoose</b> is a
        javascript library that bridges the gap between mongo shell commands and javascript. Furthermore, the web application uses another form of authentication which is the <b>LinknedIn OAuth.</b> Via this, ann user is able to retrieve basic information
        about their profile.
    </div>

    <br>
    <h2>3. Component Design</h2>
    <br> The Component Design section details the proposed design of each system component.&nbsp; A system conponent is a functional partition of the system.&nbsp; Components may be organized as you see fit - a component may be a collection of objects,
    or a single object.&nbsp; However, a system must be composed of multiple components (that is, a system cannot be one component).&nbsp;<br>
    <ul>
        <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">3.1: Login Component</h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Name</span><br> Login Component<br>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span>
                    <br> The login component, is the first component that the user sees when they start the web application. It authenticates the user and also puts the user into session. The login component also makes use of the LinknedIn OAuth to get
                    data from linknedIn to log the user in. This component also has the 'Forgot Password' feature apart from the authentication feature. For authentication, the component makes use of Local Strategy and LinkedIn Strategy. Local Strategy
                    lets an user authenticate using a username and password. LinkedIn Strategy on the other hand allows the user to log in to the web application using their LinkedIn account.
                    <br>
                </li>

                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Diagram</span><br> Below is the component diagram from the login page. Both the strategies have been depicted. <br />
                    <img src='login-component-noq.svg' style="padding-top: 20px;" />
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component User Interface</span><br> This component uses a sleek UI, with 2 input fields for the email and password, and 2 buttons - a submit button and a linkedin login button. The component also has a
                    link to reset a password and a link for the user to register.
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Objects</span><br> The login component makes use of various methods and objects. The main object is the User object. The code checks if there is an user with the user email id provided by the
                    user is present in the database, and authenticates the user. The login component generates a JWT token that is put in the session, and also puts the user information in the Vuex Store, so that all the other components can use the user
                    data.
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Interfaces (internal
      and external)</span><br> The component is not interfaced with any other component.
                    </li>
                    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Error Handling</span><br> Error Case 1: Email Validity Check: Checks for valid email format.<br> Error Case 2: Password Validity Check: Checks for valid length of password that should be greater
                        than 6.<br> Error Case 3: Verified User Check: User.isVerified variable checks if the user is verified.<br>
                        <br>
                    </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span>
                    <br> The register component is another important component, as it adds users to the database. It makes use of various libraries such as bcrypt, passport, sendgrid. Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords, passport is for registering user
                    through local strategies and sendgrid is for sending verification emails.
                    <br>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span><br> This is the chat feature of our project. The chat feature will allow applicants and recruiters to message each other once both parties have "accepted" each other. Either
                    the recruiter or applicant will write a message in a text book, which will then be sent to the other party, where the sender will be notified if the message has been "read" or not. In this feature, interviews can be set up, more information
                    on the job can be provided, and links to job assessment sites can be given. This will be a part of the main execution loop, due to the fact a user can chat whenever they feel like it, so we need to be prepared for them to do that.
