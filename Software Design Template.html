    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    This section introduces the design approach to the software system.<br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.1 System Description</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Provide a description of the system,
      and the problem that is being
      solved by developing the system (may be copied from the Project Plan or
      Software Specification if those documents are accurate).<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.2 Design Evolution</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">This section is intended to document
      the rationale behind the selected
      design solution.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.2.1 Design Issues</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">Include in this section any
      issues/requirements/constraints that drive
      the design of the system.&nbsp; This may include desired operating
      environment, interface protocols, the need to be remotely accessible,
      etc.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.2.2 Candidate Design Solutions</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">Briefly (a paragraph or two) describe
      each of the possible design
      solutions that your team discussed/explored.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.2.3 Design Solution Rationale</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">Provide some reasoning for the design
      option that your development team
      selected.&nbsp; Tie in the selected approach's ability to meet the
      requirements, and most effectively address the design issues.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.3 Design Approach</h3>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.3.1 Methods</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">

    We used object-oriented design because we believe that will best allow us to build our project. Using UML diagrams, we can easily see the relationships between each class, which allows us to further understand and develop our product.
    We also used sequence diagrams in order to showcase how the whole process will start, end, and the steps in between. This allows us to capture every step in the process, which is highly important in developing a perfect product for our customers.
    </div>
    <h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.3.2 Standards</h4>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
    We did not necessarily adhere to any singular design standard. When designing a component, we holistically evaluated the pros and cons to each design we made, ensuring the highest possible product was produced.
    For naming conventions, we went with the industry standard for uppercase class names, and camel-case for functions.
    </div>
<h4 style="margin-left: 80px;">1.3.3 Tools</h4>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"> 
We plan to use StarUML to help us design UML diagrams. In this program, we can build UML diagrams by dragging and dropping various connections/attributes, such as composition and inheritance. This is instrumental in designing UML diagrams, and the returned diagram will help us design the highest quality product.
</div>

    <h2>2. System Architecture</h2>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">2.1 System Design</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">  

      NoQ is based on the MongoDB, Express, Vue and Node technology stack. The figure below shows the system architecture at the higher level.

      <img src='noq-system-architecture.svg' style="padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px;" />

      <p>The client can access the web app through any internet based browser. The front-end technologies include <b>Vue.js</b>, which is the front-end framework, <b>Bootstrap</b>, which is a front-end styling framework, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. Vue.js can be used to make AJAX requests, make flexible and stable websites. Bootstrap is a styling library that has a plethora of classes to make a website look good. HTML and CSS are core web design languages.</p> Vue.js makes axios requests to the server that is built upon <b>Node.js</b>. <b>Express.js</b> is a library for node.js that includes a tonne of functions to handle requests and send reponses back to front-ends. The databse being used is <b>MongoDB</b>. <b>Mongoose</b> is a javascript library that bridges the gap between mongo shell commands and javascript. Furthermore, the web application uses another form of authentication which is the <b>LinknedIn OAuth.</b> Via this, ann user is able to retrieve basic information about their profile. 
    </div>

    <br>
    <h2>3. Component Design</h2>
    <br>
    The Component Design section details the proposed design of each system
    component.&nbsp; A system conponent is a functional partition of the
    system.&nbsp; Components may be organized as you see fit - a
    component may be a collection of objects, or a single object.&nbsp;
    However, a system must be composed of multiple components (that is, a
    system cannot be one component).&nbsp;<br>
        <ul>
     <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">3.1: Login Component</h3>
     <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
       <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Name</span><br>
        Login Component<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span>
        <br>
          The login component, is the first component that the user sees when they start the web application. It authenticates the user and also puts the user into session. The login component also makes use of the LinknedIn OAuth to get data from linknedIn to log the user in. This component also has the 'Forgot Password' feature apart from the authentication feature. For authentication, the component makes use of Local Strategy and LinkedIn Strategy. Local Strategy lets an user authenticate using a username and password. LinkedIn Strategy on the other hand allows the user to log in to the web application using their LinkedIn account.

     <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Diagram</span><br>
      Below is the component diagram from the login page. Both the strategies have been depicted. <br />
      <img src='login-component-noq.svg' style="padding-top: 20px;"   />
      </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component User Interface</span><br>
      This component uses a sleek UI, with 2 input fields for the email and password, and 2 buttons - a submit button and a linkedin login button. The component also has a link to reset a password and a link for the user to register.
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Objects</span><br>
        The login component makes use of various methods and objects. The main object is the User object. The code checks if there is an user with the user email id provided by the user is present in the database, and authenticates the user. The login component generates a JWT token that is put in the session, and also puts the user information in the Vuex Store, so that all the other components can use the user data.
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Interfaces (internal
      and external)</span><br>
      The component is not interfaced with any other component.
      </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Error Handling</span><br>
      Error Case 1: Email Validity Check: Checks for valid email format.<br>
      Error Case 2: Password Validity Check: Checks for valid length of password that should be greater than 6.<br>
      Error Case 3: Verified User Check: User.isVerified variable checks if the user is verified.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
     </div>

  <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">3.2: Register Component</h3>
     <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
       <ul>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Name</span><br>
        Register Component<br>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span>
        <br>
          The register component is another important component, as it adds users to the database. It makes use of various libraries such as bcrypt, passport, sendgrid. 
         Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords, passport is for registering user through local strategies and sendgrid is for sending verification emails. 
        <br>

      </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component User Interface</span><br>
      This component uses a sleek UI, with innput fields for email, password, re-enter password. A select box for selectign the type of user. A ninput box for phone number.
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Objects</span><br>
        The register component makes use of various methods and objects. The main object is the User object. The code checks if there is an user with the user email id provided by the user is present in the database, and if not adds it to the database. The component also sennds an email via sendgrid for the verification of the user. 
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Interfaces (internal
      and external)</span><br>
      The component is not interfaced with any other component.

      </li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span>
        <br>
          The Profile component is the actual profile of the applicant, recruiter, or company. For the applicant, it will feature experience, skills, education, name, and a link to their LinkedIn. For
		  the recruiter, it will feature their company, name, and contact info. Finally for the company, it will feature their name, location, and a description of what they offer.

		This component for applicants will feature 3 main fields, one for skills, one for education, and another for experience. Similarly for all 3 types of profiles, the name and company/school will be located at the top of the profile.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Objects</span><br>
		The applicants profile will be passed to the job listing object when applying, and the company profile will be passed to the job listing object as the company an applicant is applying for. The profile name will also be used in the chat component, as a user must know whom they are communicating with. <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Interfaces (internal
      and external)</span><br>
      The component is not interfaced with any other component.

	<h3>3.4: Chat Component</h3>
		<div>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Name</span><br>
      Chat
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Description</span><br>
      This is the chat feature of our project. The chat feature will allow applicants and recruiters to message each other once both parties have "accepted" each other. Either the recruiter or applicant will write a message in a text book, which will
      then be sent to the other party, where the sender will be notified if the message has been "read" or not. In this feature, interviews can be set up, more information on the job can be provided, and links to job assessment sites can be given. This will be a part of the main execution loop,
      due to the fact a user can chat whenever they feel like it, so we need to be prepared for them to do that. 
        </li>

        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component User Interface</span><br>
      The user will see a text box upon entering a chat with another user, there will be a button to submit the message, as well as the ability to hit 'enter'. 
      When the other user is typing, 3 bubbles will appear to show that the user is indeed typing. Furthermore, a user will see a "read" message once the other user has read their message.
	  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Objects</span><br></li>
			This component will be called by the "add" method of the MongoDB object. 
			It will receive data from User object in String format. 
			Furthermore, it will call the methods of the module we use for chatting, TBD.
	<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Interfaces (internal
      and external)</span><br>
      The component is not interfaced with any other component.
      </li>
   <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component Error Handling</span><br>
      Error Case 1: Completed Message: This will check if the user has typed something in the chat box, as we do not want
	  to send an empty message to another user.
