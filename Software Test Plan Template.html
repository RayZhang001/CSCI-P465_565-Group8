<h2>1. Overview</h2>
This section provides an overview of the testing approach used to
verify the software product.<br>
<h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">1.1 Test Objectives</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Provide a description of the objectives
of the test.&nbsp; That is, what is it that is to be accomplished by
the testing effort.<br>
<br>
The testing effort wants to accomplish complete coverage of all features of our project. &nbsp;That is, we want to make sure the
results users are experiencing are in-line with the results we expect for every component of the project.

<h3>1.2 Test Environment</h3>
Describe the environment that will be used to test the software
product.&nbsp; Include a description of the hardware and operating
system of all machines involved in the test.&nbsp; Describe the
networking between those machines (if your product requires network
support).&nbsp; Describe any support software packages that need to be
installed/available/running on the machine for the software to
operate.&nbsp; Comment on whether the test environment is the same as
the operational environment, and descibe any differences.<br>
<br>
Our testing environment will consist of multiple computers, with some running Mac OS and the others running Windows 10. These machines are powerful enough 
for the usages of testing, so there will not be an issue with hardware. Each machine will be running the tests independently, so there is no need for 
network communication between them. For the tests to be ran, there will be a couple software packages that need to be installed, these include:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Vue.js</li>
  <li>Express.js</li>
  
</ul>
The testing environment will be the same as the operational environment, as we want to assure the features we are testing will work in the production environment.
<h3>1.3 Test Personnel</h3>
Describe the personnel involved in the testing effort, and the roles
that they will fill.&nbsp; Describe the level of user involvement in
the testing process (if any).<br>
<br>
Every member of the team will have an integral part of the testing effort. There will be no set in stone roles, as having the team experience all areas of testing
will allow for better coverage and testing techniques. There will be no user involvement in the testing process, due to the fact we  believe we can test, and fix any
potential issues that may arise.
<br>
<h3>1.4 Acceptance Criteria</h3>
Under what conditions will the software be considered acceptable to
deliver.&nbsp; For example, how many errors will you tolerate before
the testing is abandoned to correct the errors and try again?&nbsp; Or,
how many of the requirements need to be verified before the software is
considered deliverable.&nbsp; Identify in this section an acceptance
criteria that is feasible for your development team and acceptable for
your customer/user.<br>
<br>
We will not accept any errors during the testing phase. If we run a test and confirm that it is indeed our implementation that is wrong, we will immediately fix it to pass the tests.
Every single one of the requirements must be met for our product to be considered deliverable. Anything less than perfection will not be permitted in the development of our product. 
The acceptance criteria that will be feasible for both our customers and us is that of a product which fills all of the requirements the customer listed. <br>
<h3>1.5 Noted Omissions</h3>
Identify any software specification statements that are not intended to
be verified by this test, and justify the exclusion of these
specifications.<br><br>
All software specification statements will be covered by this test, as we need to be 100% sure that our product is up to par.
<br>
</div>
<h2>2. Test Cases </h2>
The test cases are the partitioning of the verification of the software
into manageable sections.&nbsp; Often these sections correspond to the
set of active use case scenarios, but can be organized as the test
developer sees fit.&nbsp; Test cases should be in place to cover all of
the software verification methods.&nbsp; Even non-execution based
testing methods (i.e., inspection/analysis) may be detailed here.&nbsp;
The intent is for the test case procedures to provide a repeatable
verification of the software specification.<br>
<br>
For each test case describe the following:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Number:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Provide a unique number for the Test Case<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Name:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Provide a unique, descriptive name for the Test Case.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Provide a summary description (1-3 sentences) of the Test Case, and
what is intended to be verified by the test case.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Initial Conditions:</span> Describe
any unique conditions in the test environment that must be in place to
run the test.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, note whether another Test Case is intended to be run prior to
this Test Case.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Input Data:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Describe any specific data inputs that are to be used in the Test Case <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e.g., a mock data file, a test user ID, erroroneous inputs to
stimulate error conditions, etc).<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Specifications:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
List the Specificaiton statements (by number) that are intended to be
verified by this Test Case.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Provide a link to the Test Case Procedure for this Test Case.<br>
<br>
You may represent this information as a table, or simply list it.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If you are using the
rigorous process, the Specifications described above are already
captured in the RVM and may be omitted from this document<br>
