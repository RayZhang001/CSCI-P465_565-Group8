<h2>New Business</h2>
<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussions
Summary:</span> Document any discussions that took place during the
meeting.&nbsp; Note specifics of the conversation, particularly for
customer meetings.&nbsp; In this section it needs to be evident what
topics were discussed in a fair amount of detail.<br><br>

Discussion on benefits of guest views. Cole and Paul defended the need to log-in before seeing jobs due to the fact that since noQ is career fair orientated, it is necessary to verify you status as a student, similar to SICE Careers. Adeel might want a view for users not in the system, will discuss later. Set of security questions for further password reset verification. Need to use a captcha to verify reset password as well.
Update to footer to add location and other information. Conduct a design session before starting to code the next steps, will help us visualize the process better and will produce better code.
